<p>This booklet describes the more important points
along the Lassen Park Road. To get the most enjoyment
from this pamphlet make a leisurely trip&mdash;drive
slowly. Visitors find it most practical to read
about the next point of interest before coming to
it, often having someone other than the driver read
this aloud while traveling.</p>
<p>In the left hand margin of the text is a series of
numbers which correspond to numbered markers
along the road marking the point of interest. Explanations
follow each number in the text. The fume
cloud on the roadside markers points in the direction
of the feature. If you are entering via Manzanita
Lake Entrance Station, start from the last of this
book, and read the numbers in descending sequence.</p>
<p>The mileage shown in parentheses in the center
line of the pages indicates the distance between successive
points driving either way.</p>

<p>Lassen Volcanic National Park was established by act of Congress
in 1916 from lands of the Lassen National Forest and the small
Lassen Peak and Cinder Cone National Monuments formerly under
the Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture. The park area
now measures approximately 10 by 17 miles, embracing about 165
square miles.</p>
<p>The Lassen Park Road is a link in State Route No. 89. It runs
through Lassen Volcanic National Park, half circling the east side
of Lassen Peak. This road was built by the National Park Service
of the U. S. Department of the Interior to make accessible by car
some of the finest scenery in the park. The road is not designed
for high speed. The slower you drive the more you will see. Like
you, others are sight seeing, so drive carefully and observe the
warning signs at all times. Remember: an accident may ruin your
vacation, your car, and even your life. Maximum speed is 45 miles
per hour, but in many places this is excessive.</p>
<p>While using this guide you will want to stop many times. Be
sure to park OFF THE PAVEMENT to prevent accidents. In the
spring when heavy snowdrifts line the road, it will not be practical
to stop in certain areas, nor will it be possible to see some of the
things described in this publication.</p>
<p>Other books dealing in greater detail with the interpretation
of the natural and human history of the area may be purchased in
the Visitor Center at Manzanita Lake.</p>

<p><span class="mm" id="mm1">1</span> THE RAKER MEMORIAL was sponsored
by the California State Chamber of Commerce
in 1931 in honor of Congressman John
E. Raker who was Representative of the State
for 15 years. It was he who introduced the successful
bill to Congress recommending the establishment
of Lassen Volcanic
National Park. The bill was
signed by Pres. Wilson on August 9, 1916. John Raker died
in 1926. Appropriately, this
is also the boundary between
the National Park
and Lassen National Forest.
Although the National Park
Service and the National Forest Service differ
in conservation policies, they cooperate
very closely on mutual matters, such as
forest fire and forest pest control.</p>

uphill side of the road. It is a 3.5 mile hike to the summit at 9,235
feet. The elevation here at the road is 6,640 feet.</p>
<p>The common shrub-like trees along the first part of the trail
are the mountain alder and willow. (see sketch). In the fall the
willow leaves turn bright yellow. Both species lose their leaves
in winter.</p>

<p><span class="mm" id="mm5">5</span> SULPHUR WORKS is the most easily accessible hydrothermal
area in the Park. It is probably part of the central vent
system of ancient Mt. Tehama which is described at No. 7. A short
paved trail leads to the sputtering hot springs, steaming fumeroles
and hot bubbling mud pots. For your own safety be sure to stay
on the trails in any of the thermal areas. Slippery clay and thin
crusty coverings could lead to a dunking in scalding hot water
and mud. Most water in the thermal areas of the Park contain
sulphurous or sulphuric acid, so avoid getting it on your clothes.
The odor is mainly that of hydrogen sulphide. Much of the white
clay is tinted yellow, tan or pink by mineral impurities, chiefly
iron oxides.</p>
<p>The name Sulphur Works was first used in 1865 when efforts
were made by T. M. Boarman and Dr. M. Supan to develop the
sulphur and clay potentialities of the area. This land was filed
upon originally as a mining claim but was actively used only for
the tourist trade beginning about 1940. Some of the non-acidic
thermal water was used for hot baths. The property was acquired
by the Federal Government in 1951 and added to the National
Park to be used as a natural thermal area exhibit.</p>

<p>In early summer the flowers along the road for the next
mile or two, are spectacular. Yellow balsam root (with arrowhead-shaped
leaves), mules ears (with similar blossoms), and blue
stickseed, which looks like forgetmenot, are the most showy.
In late summer tall stalks of false hellebore and yellow senecio
are common.</p>

the north side, hence the name &ldquo;Brokeoff&rdquo;. This mountain is a
flank remnant of ancestral Mount Tehama which once towered
more than 1,000 feet higher than Lassen Peak. Tehama was a
composite, or strato-type volcano like Mt. Shasta. It was destroyed
by a series of cracks, called faults, which cut Tehama into huge
blocks. These sunk, causing collapse of the great mountain. Mt.
Conard to the southeast, and the ridge between Brokeoff and
Lassen Peak, are also remnants of the Tehama rim, all dipping
away from the center of the old volcano.</p>

<p><span class="mm" id="mm18">18</span> LAKE HELEN is a deep, blue, glacial lake at 8,164 feet elevation.
It is frozen over for 7 or 8 months a year, and is very cold
even in summer being 39 degrees at depth. Lake Helen is exceptional
among Lassen&rsquo;s lakes in that fish plantings here have been
unsuccessful ... perhaps because of a lack of native food.</p>
<p>This body of water was named by Major Pierson B. Reading
for Mrs. Helen Tanner Brodt who ascended Lassen Peak with him
in 1864, the first woman known to have made the climb.</p>
<p>Lassen Peak is across the lake to the northwest. The cliffs
represent portions of the original plug of stiff, pasty dacite lava
which was forced up rapidly as a unit through the crust of the
earth. Along the right shoulder of Lassen the trail zig-zags up the
mountain.</p>
<p>On the side of the road away from the lake is a large andesite
lava outcrop of vertical plates, or slabs. Known as jointing,
this has been caused by strains set up in the cooling lava
mass after it hardened. This helps to wear away mountains because
water seeps into these cracks and wedges them apart when it
freezes and expands.</p>

about 2,000 feet: from 8,500 feet to 10,457 feet in 2&frac12; miles of hiking.
It takes most persons about 4 hours for the round trip, though some
take an hour more, and a few an hour less. For a pleasant hike:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Wear low heeled, sturdy shoes.</dt>
<dt>2. Hike at a moderate pace, taking short, frequent rests and enjoy the ever-changing view.</dt>
<dt>3. Take a lunch along.</dt>
<dt>4. You can eat snow for water, but do so slowly, otherwise it may make you ill.</dt>
<dt>5. Dark glasses, sunburn lotion, and a hat are advisable.</dt>
<dt>6. Do not start later than 2 hours before sunset, or when storms or fog threaten.</dt>
<dt>7. DO NOT TAKE SHORT-CUTS ACROSS THE TRAIL. It is against Park Regulations and is inadvisable because:</dt>
<dd>a. It is dangerous: sprained or broken ankles and arms may result.</dd>
<dd>b. Unavoidable dislodging of rocks is dangerous to hikers below.</dd>
<dd>c. It costs money to rebuild the trail which short-cutting ruins.</dd></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>On the rise to the left of the trail, the parallel markings in
the rock is known as flow banding and takes place when the lava
is still moving but cooling rapidly. Directly above this banding, on
top of the rock formation, is glacial polish, which indicates that the
lava cooled long before the Ice Age.</p>
<p>In climbing the Peak, the trail leaves the Hudsonian Life Zone
with mountain hemlocks and white-bark pine, and at timber line
it enters the Arctic-Alpine Life Zone.</p>

southeast are the High Sierra including Pyramid Peak in the
vicinity of Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>To the west is the rough black dacite lava of 1915 which filled
and obliterated Lassen&rsquo;s 1914 Crater. This lava also spilled through
the northeast notch, causing the Great Mudflow of May 19, 1915.
Just beyond the 1915 lava is the 1915-1916 crater formed by the
great explosive eruption of May 22, 1915. It now contains a tiny
lake, sapphire blue when not frozen over. The notch on Lassen&rsquo;s
western skyline, just beyond, is the 1917 crater. There are active
steam vents in the west and north portions of this basin, but the
steam does not always condense well enough to be seen easily.
There are yellow deposits of sulphur on the north wall of 1915-1916
crater.</p>
<p>On the west side of the crater basin, the 1915-1916 and the 1917
craters can be seen, and also the Brokeoff-Lassen Ridge to the

paymaster, and was involved in the Bear Flag revolt. Reading also
discovered gold on Clear Creek in March 1848, and was the first

October 11, 1962, winds of gale force, sweeping up through the
valleys from the southeast, blew down and broke off many large
trees. This is typical of the story of violence and peace of the
Lassen area. In a few years the young growth will hide most of the
devastation.</p>
<p>The short, blue-green, single needles of the red fir grow in
a brush-like manner. Very symmetrical, the trees are called &ldquo;Silver
Tips&rdquo; in the commercial Christmas tree market.</p>
<p>The trunks curve at their base due to the heavy snowfall
which bends the saplings downhill, flat to the ground. In the
spring the young trees curve up, but the bend remains, and
persists throughout the life of the tree. Curved trunks can also
be found in other species of trees, such as mountain hemlock.</p>

<p><span class="mm" id="mm44">44</span> HEART OF THE DEVASTATED AREA. 10,457-foot Lassen
Peak rises about 4,000 feet to the southwest. It is the largest plug
volcano known. It was formed rapidly, being forced up as a stiff
pasty mass of lava.</p>
<p>On May 30, 1914, without warning, Lassen Peak started a
series of eruptions which lasted through 1917. The hundred eruptions
during the first year were steam explosions which threw out
ash, cinders and boulders, thus clearing out a new crater. On May
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
19, 1915, a black dacite lava flow welled up into this crater and
spilled over to the southwest and northeast. At the southwest the
lava descended about 1,000 feet on the Sacramento Valley side of
the mountain, cooled and hardened. However, the lava coming
down the northeast slope broke off in large pasty chunks, quickly
melting a huge accumulation of snow. The resulting water, mixed
with the large volume of fine and coarse debris from earlier
eruptions formed a great mudflow which roared down the mountainside.
Divided by Raker Peak, part of this mudflow went down
Lost Creek, which the main road now follows northward. The rest
went over the 100 foot rise in the east and down that Creek. It cut
a swath through the forest which had been continuous across
Lassen&rsquo;s lower and middle slopes. Fertile meadows were covered
by as much as 20 feet of mudflow debris. The bark of trees on the
edge of the mudflow was pounded and ripped off as high as 18
feet above the ground.</p>

<p>Three days later (May 22, 1915) a great explosive eruption
blasted out a new crater atop Lassen Peak, just west of the one
which had been filled with, and sealed off, by the new lava. A portion
of the explosive force was deflected downward. The resulting Hot
Blast took the same, but wider, path the mudflow had taken. Trees
left standing along the mudflow margins were uprooted or broken
off by the blast and thrown down, all pointing away from Lassen
Peak for a distance of 3 miles from the summit crater. Of the logs
and snags which constitute an important part of this evidence,
many have already rotted and weathered away since 1915. Some
still show the abrasion and impact marks of mudflow and hotblast
missiles.</p>

are also visible on its lower slope. The mountain was named Raker
Peak in 1933 to perpetuate the memory of John E. Raker, Representative

Lassen a National Park in 1916.</p>
<p>Across the road to the west, on the left base of the slope, is a
small patch of mature trees. The mound, called &ldquo;SURVIVORS

<p>This vicinity is known as SUNFLOWER FLAT due to the
abundance of the flower-like plant called wooly wyethia which
blossoms in mid-summer. Other flowers to be seen are: skyrocket
gilia, California stickweed, Nuttall larkspur, and Pacific monardella.
A few brilliant red snowplants are often to be found here
up into mid-summer. Remember, no flower picking is allowed
in our National Parks.</p>

of CHAOS JUMBLES ... the huge landslide from nearby Chaos
Crags.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>This upper edge of the hummocky rock debris is thin, and lies
on a relatively flat undersurface. As a result, the forest trees grow
normally here, in contrast to the dwarf forest to be found on the
main mass of thick, sloping, and very porous Jumbles.</p>
<p>The pale yellow-green, moss-like material on the tree trunks
is called staghorn lichen. It is not a moss, but is a union of two
plants growing together; a fungus, giving it form and body, and
an alga, growing inside and manufacturing food for both from the
air and sunshine. Lichens do not in any way harm the trees, and
grow as well on dead material.</p>
<p class="center">(0.6 mile)</p>
<p><span class="mm" id="mm63">63</span> The pink mountain mass to the south is CHAOS CRAGS.
It is composed of three plug volcanos of a lava known as dacite. This
material was rapidly pushed up in a molten state, much as one
would squeeze paste from a tube. As the lava plugs cooled and
hardened, steam explosions took place from the base of the cliff,
undermining it and causing at least three tremendous avalanches
estimated as occurring about 1700 years ago, 700 years ago and
the most recent in about the year 1690. Due to the small amount
of soil and porous rock, many of the stunted trees in this Dwarf
Forest are over 200 years old.</p>

<p>The LILY POND SELF-GUIDING NATURE TRAIL, an easy

It is unique in having ten species of cone-bearing trees and
three species of broad-leaved trees along its short and nearly

common rodents are the golden-mantled ground squirrel and the
chipmunk.</p>
<p>The Loomis Museum, with a tract of 40 acres, was given to
the Federal Government in 1927 by Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F.
Loomis in memory of their daughter, Mae. On this land are now

Peak and Chaos Crags to be seen in it from near the picnic ground.
It is an excellent place for photography, especially in the afternoon

elevation 5,845 feet. This lake is young, formed by the Chaos

the Northern California Power Company, for electric power development
purposes by the construction of a small earth dam at the
lake&rsquo;s southwest extremity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Like most of Lassen&rsquo;s lakes, it is well stocked with trout. In the
fall large numbers of waterfowl, including Canada geese, stop here
en route to their wintering grounds.</p>
<p>The lake derived its name from the abundance of greenleaf
manzanita on its shores. This shrub can be seen across the lake

lake. It is a fine area for taking photographs, especially in the
afternoon and early evening. Lassen Peak towers 4,625 feet above
Manzanita Lake to an elevation of 10,457 feet. The summit notch
in the 1917 crater, and the black tongue extending down toward

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
